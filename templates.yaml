        Welcome to Transit Tracker.
        What station would you like a predicted time for?

help: |
    I can help you out with letting you know about alerts or delays that you might hit on your way to the T.
    Try asking, about alerts for a specific line or for a predicted travel time for one station to another.

invalid_direction: |
    Sorry, but {{ station }} doesn't go {{ requested_direction }}. It only goes {{ valid_directions }}.
    Try asking again with valid directions.

bye: Goodbye
